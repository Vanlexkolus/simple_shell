This is a simple Unix-like shell project implemented in C by Alexander Kolurejo and Endurance Apeh. The project aims to provide a basic understanding of how a shell works and can serve as a starting point for more advanced shell development.
Thanks to Julian Barbier and ALX for teaching us all we need to know in order to be able to create this amazing project.
